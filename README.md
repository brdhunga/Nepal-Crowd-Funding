# Crowd-source-funding-for-Nepal

Nepal currretly lacks a crowd sourced funding platform. It still lacks a good online based payment system and being able
pay online with ease is going to take some time. 

However there is a significant number of Nepalese who have settled abroad and are willing to help Nepalese entreprenurial,
social and non-profit ventures. This project will allow payments to Nepalese projects using international credit and debit
cards until NRB (Nepal Rastra Bank) becomes flexible enough to allow intra Nepal online payment. 


## Technical details
